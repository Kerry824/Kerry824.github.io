	<p>Disadvantages:Unfortunately, you have to pay a little extra for 256GB of storage; The 128GB model is slightly cheaper, starting at 9,999 yuan. You'll also have to use two ThunderBolt 3 ports instead of the four on the pricier 13-inch MacBook Pro. You'll also get fewer features and less storage than the pricier Pro.This version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro is expensive. Battery life is good at 8 hours and 41 minutes. But other ultra-portable products take longer to charge</p>
